# Blackboard
A simple drawing and animation thingy written in Processing (processing.org).

Watch the video where I created this program here --> youtube.com/@dubiouspotential

For anyone serious about decent graphics and animation, I'd suggest finding a better solution elsewhere

I really don't understand github and only use it as a code-dump. If you want to modify this code, please take a copy and do it elsewhere (is that called a fork? maybe... idk) since I won't be admining changes in this repo (unless I decide to periodically update it myself).

If you like this program:
  1) I'm slightly concerned, but thanks.
  2) Please give my youtube channel some algorythmic appreciation.
